  <h2 style="margin: 10px;">Team Bully Busters</h2>
  <p style="margin: 10px;">We are Team Cyber Bully Busters, a team of college students who are passionate about creating an environment where people can thrive without the fear of being harrassed for their passions. Our mission is to raise awareness on the effects of cyber bullying and how parents and children alike can help one another confront these issues and grow past these issues together.</p>
  <br>
  <p>This project was important to us because we have all lived in an era where cyber bullying was the number one form of harrassment our friends and peers have had to deal with while in school. From the popularization of social media to having access to laptops in school, we have grown up around technology and seen first hand how it can help and how it can hurt. We wanted this site to offer everyone involved in the online world the resources they need in order help combat cyber bullying.</p>
